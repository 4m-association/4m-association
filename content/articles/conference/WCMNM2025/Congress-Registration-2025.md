An instruction on how to register can be seen <a href="/files/Procedure registration WCMNM 2022.pdf">here</a>

Payment is possible by credit card or via an invoice. If you choose to pay by credit card, you will receive a payment receipt but we will not be able to generate an invoice afterwards.
For participants who require an invitation letter for their VISA application, we recommend to pay by credit card as this is faster. The invitation letter will be sent after the payment has been received.
