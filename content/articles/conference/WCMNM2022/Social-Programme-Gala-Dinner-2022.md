To kick start our conference, we invite all participants on Monday 19 September at 7pm to a Welcome Reception offered by the City of Leuven in the sumptuous town hall, situated in the center of city.  
The town hall is Leuven's pride and joy. Moreover, it is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 235 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. The Saint Peter's Church is located directly opposite the Town Hall. 
These days the town hall merely has a ceremonial function after the city's administrative services moved in 2009. 
 
 
 <h3>Wednesday 21 September 2022: City Walking Tour and Congress Dinner </h3>
  
All conference participants are invited to the WCMNM 2022 Congress Dinner on Wednesday 21 September. The dinner will take place at the Faculty Club located in a well preserved site of Leuven which has a rich history dating back to the thirteenth century.  

Prior to the dinner, we are planning a city walking tour in Leuven on the following theme:

<h4>University walk - from Erasmus to the big Bang</h4>

Every year, more than 50,000 students study at one of the oldest universities in Europe. How do they live and how did they live? Leuven is synonymous with more than 500 years of innovative research. Not only the history of the university is discussed, but also its significance as an international contemporary center of scientific practice. 
The route leads past a number of university colleges and buildings (Lakenhalle, colleges in the Naamsestraat, Pauscollege, Central University Library). The common thread is the daily life of professors and students at the university - both in the Middle Ages and in the time of Erasmus.

 <h3>Thursday 22 September 2022: Visit Beer Brewery </h3>
 
 On Thursday afternoon, we will offer the possibility to join a guided tour to the Stella Artois Brewery in Leuven.
 
<h4>About the Stella Artois brewery</h4>

Seven centuries of brewing traditions guarantee a perfectly brewed Stella Artois in the heart of the university city of Leuven. And you can see it with your own eyes during one of the entirely renewed, impressive and entertaining brewery visits.
During the guided tour, which takes approximately one hour and a half, you will become familiar with all major aspects of the Stella Artois brewing process: the brand’s history, the brewing process and the breathtakingly fast bottling and canning lines.
