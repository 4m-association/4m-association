  <div></div>
To kick start our conference, we invite all participants on Monday 19 September at 7pm to a Welcome Reception offered by the City of Leuven in the sumptuous town hall, situated in the center of city.  
The town hall is Leuven's pride and joy. Moreover, it is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 235 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. The Saint Peter's Church is located directly opposite the Town Hall. 
These days the town hall merely has a ceremonial function after the city's administrative services moved in 2009.
